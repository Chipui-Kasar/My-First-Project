      <h2><b>New interface</b></h2>
      <p>
        When Mobile Legends was first released, one of the biggest appeals was
        that it successfully brought MOBA gaming to smartphones. So while its UI
        was praised for this, there were arguably some issues in terms of
        cleanliness and visual appeal.
      </p>
      <p>
        The new UI has taken these minor complaints into consideration and
        Moonton released a setup that is easier and more efficient to navigate.
        Even just looking at the homepage is a welcome change. The functions are
        neatly placed and segmented together so that the player can see more of
        the playing field.
      </p>

      <h2><b>New features</b></h2>
      <p>
        A new event has been released as well: Mystery Treasure. Players might
        find themselves a mystery treasure, which could contain skins and other
        such rewards. Each Lucky Treasure can be opened with 30 diamonds and
        each player can only unlock 10 during the event period. Consider
        yourself lucky if you come across one because there are only a certain
        number of them available.
      </p>

      The event start time will be announced later on.<br />

      <h2><b>New hero</b></h2>
      <p>
        What is arguably more exciting, however, are the new heroes. The first
        one is Karrie, priced at 499 Diamonds, BP 24,000. She is very gifted and
        went through intense training to become the warrior leader that she is
        now. Her skills include the Spinning Lightwheel (the flywheel will stay
        at the destination and cause damage as well as slow down enemies in its
        path) and Phantomstep (releases a lightwheel attack at the nearest
        opponent).
      </p>

      <p>
        Then there is Eudora, whose default model and display special effects
        were improved. The attack and skills special effects were also
        optimized. If you’ve been waiting to download the update, there’s no
        need to delay. The new Mobile Legends is crisp, clear and so worth it.
      </p>
